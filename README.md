# The streamlit_abt repo contains a python script and geojson file that feed into a Streamlit WebApp. This WebApp can be accessed via "https://madagascar-wvi-v2.streamlit.app/". At present, the app is not publicly available. If you would like, you can fork this repo and create your own free version of the map using Streamlit.IO. 

For any questions, please email me at gideon_singer@abtassoc.com.

Cheers,
Gideon Singer, Ph.D.
